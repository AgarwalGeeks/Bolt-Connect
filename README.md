# Bolt-Connect
# Overview
It is always great to control a microcontroller from an android app .
So this project focuses on controlling BotIot (Microcontroller) from android app.
I have built an android app named Bot-Connect which can control Bolt-Iot in very easy and efficient way.
   

## Implementation 
We can connect our Bolt-Cloud using Bolt Cloud Api .
so what i have done i used volley to make HTTP Request and Response.
for every event of Bolt it generates a HTTP url and make a HTTP request ,
BoltCloud api respond to the request and give it back to the Android app.
so in this way we can do anything with bolt with this Mobile App.
